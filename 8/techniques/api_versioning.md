# API version in the URL

## Problem

What is an easily accessible method to provide versioned APIs? A change in the API version needs to be easy to see and work with.

## Solution

Provide the API version in the REST API URL.

> See [example](../api_versioning_url.go).

## Discussion

Google, OpenStack, Salesforce, Twitter, and Facebook are a few examples that use APIs versioned this way.
