## Problem

You want to avoid duplicating the common sections of HTML markup in each template and the maintenance burden that goes along with that. You want to take advantage of reuse.

## Solution

Use nested templates to share common sections of HTML. The subtemplates enable reuse for sections of markup, cutting down on duplication.

> See the [example](../nested_templates).

## Discussion

The template system is Go is designed to handle multiple templates and allow them to work together.
